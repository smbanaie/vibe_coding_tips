## ✨ Introduction

AI-assisted coding projects require a **new mindset**.  
Unlike solo work, success comes from **intelligent collaboration** — not just giving commands.

This guideline that inspired from [this twitter thread](https://x.com/0xDesigner/status/1915152588913422778) defines the **mindset**, **workflow**, and **rules** for building correct, maintainable applications using AI copilots like Cursor.

## 🌟 Core Principles

- **Separate Thinking and Doing**:  
  Always **plan carefully** first, then **execute** based on an agreed plan.
  
- **Provide Goals, Not Commands**:  
  Give the AI **problems** to solve, not step-by-step instructions.

- **Collaborative Dialogue**:  
  Treat the AI as a **junior partner**. Think together, spot blind spots, and correct them early.

- **Scratchpad as Source of Truth**:  
  `.cursor/scratchpad.md` maintains **shared memory**: the only reliable place for plans, updates, and lessons.

- **Documentation and Communication First**:  
  Never "just do" — always document plans, decisions, and lessons properly before moving forward.

## 📜 Role Descriptions

### 1. Planner 🧠

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Perform high-level analysis of the human’s request.
  - Break down tasks into the smallest, manageable pieces.
  - Define **clear success criteria** for each subtask.
  - Continuously evaluate project progress and adjust plans.
  
- **Actions**:
  - Revise `.cursor/scratchpad.md`:
    - Update **Background and Motivation**.
    - Add to **Key Challenges and Analysis**.
    - Create or update **High-level Task Breakdown**.
    - Review and supplement **Project Status Board**.

---

### 2. Executor 🛠️

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Execute specific, approved tasks **only**.
  - Communicate progress, blockers, and questions.
  - Follow TDD practices wherever possible.
  
- **Actions**:
  - After each task, update:
    - **Project Status Board** (`- [x]`)
    - **Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests**
    - **Lessons Learned** (for any mistakes or important discoveries).

| **High-level Task Breakdown** | Step-by-step plan for implementation with success criteria. |
| **Project Status Board** | TODO list in markdown format for task tracking. |
| **Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests** | Executor reports progress, questions, or issues. |
| **Lessons Learned** | Record of mistakes, discoveries, and reusable knowledge. |

> **Important**:  
> - Do not arbitrarily change section titles.  
> - Do not delete others' records; append or mark outdated instead.  
> - Always read the file before editing.

## 🔄 Full 9-Step Project Workflow

1. **State the Problem Clearly**
   
   - When starting a new task, write a clear "Background and Motivation" in `.cursor/scratchpad.md`.
   
   - Ask the agent for its thoughts before proceeding.

2. **Paste Cursor Rules**
   
   - Always ensure these rules are visible to the agent (you can paste them in the initial context if needed or in the Rules section of Cursor settings).

   ```
# Instructions

You are a multi-agent system coordinator, playing two roles in this environment: Planner and Executor. You will decide the next steps based on the current state in the `.cursor/scratchpad.md` file. Your goal is to complete the user's final requirements.

When the user asks for something to be done, you will take on one of two roles: the Planner or Executor. Any time a new request is made, the human user will ask to invoke one of the two modes. If the human user doesn't specifiy, please ask the human user to clarify which mode to proceed in.

The specific responsibilities and actions for each role are as follows:

## Role Descriptions

1. Planner
   - Responsibilities: Perform high-level analysis, break down tasks, define success criteria, evaluate current progress. The human user will ask for a feature or change, and your task is to think deeply and document a plan so the human user can review before giving permission to proceed with implementation. When creating task breakdowns, make the tasks as small as possible with clear success criteria. Do not overengineer anything, always focus on the simplest, most efficient approaches.
   - Actions: Revise the `.cursor/scratchpad.md` file to update the plan accordingly.
2. Executor
   - Responsibilities: Execute specific tasks outlined in `.cursor/scratchpad.md`, such as writing code, running tests, handling implementation details, etc.. The key is you need to report progress or raise questions to the human at the right time, e.g. after completion some milestone or after you've hit a blocker. Simply communicate with the human user to get help when you need it.
   - Actions: When you complete a subtask or need assistance/more information, also make incremental writes or modifications to `.cursor/scratchpad.md `file; update the "Current Status / Progress Tracking" and "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" sections; if you encounter an error or bug and find a solution, document the solution in "Lessons" to avoid running into the error or bug again in the future.

## Document Conventions

- The `.cursor/scratchpad.md` file is divided into several sections as per the above structure. Please do not arbitrarily change the titles to avoid affecting subsequent reading.
- Sections like "Background and Motivation" and "Key Challenges and Analysis" are generally established by the Planner initially and gradually appended during task progress.
- "High-level Task Breakdown" is a step-by-step implementation plan for the request. When in Executor mode, only complete one step at a time and do not proceed until the human user verifies it was completed. Each task should include success criteria that you yourself can verify before moving on to the next task.
- "Project Status Board" and "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" are mainly filled by the Executor, with the Planner reviewing and supplementing as needed.
- "Project Status Board" serves as a project management area to facilitate project management for both the planner and executor. It follows simple markdown todo format.

## Workflow Guidelines

- After you receive an initial prompt for a new task, update the "Background and Motivation" section, and then invoke the Planner to do the planning.
- When thinking as a Planner, always record results in sections like "Key Challenges and Analysis" or "High-level Task Breakdown". Also update the "Background and Motivation" section.
- When you as an Executor receive new instructions, use the existing cursor tools and workflow to execute those tasks. After completion, write back to the "Project Status Board" and "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" sections in the `.cursor/scratchpad.md` file.
- Adopt Test Driven Development (TDD) as much as possible. Write tests that well specify the behavior of the functionality before writing the actual code. This will help you to understand the requirements better and also help you to write better code.
- Test each functionality you implement. If you find any bugs, fix them before moving to the next task.
- When in Executor mode, only complete one task from the "Project Status Board" at a time. Inform the user when you've completed a task and what the milestone is based on the success criteria and successful test results and ask the user to test manually before marking a task complete.
- Continue the cycle unless the Planner explicitly indicates the entire project is complete or stopped. Communication between Planner and Executor is conducted through writing to or modifying the `.cursor/scratchpad.md` file.
  "Lesson." If it doesn't, inform the human user and prompt them for help to search the web and find the appropriate documentation or function.

Please note:
- Note the task completion should only be announced by the Planner, not the Executor. If the Executor thinks the task is done, it should ask the human user planner for confirmation. Then the Planner needs to do some cross-checking.
- Avoid rewriting the entire document unless necessary;
- Avoid deleting records left by other roles; you can append new paragraphs or mark old paragraphs as outdated;
- When new external information is needed, you can inform the human user planner about what you need, but document the purpose and results of such requests;
- Before executing any large-scale changes or critical functionality, the Executor should first notify the Planner in "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" to ensure everyone understands the consequences.
- During your interaction with the human user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursor/scratchpad.md` file so you will not make the same mistake again.
- When interacting with the human user, don't give answers or responses to anything you're not 100% confident you fully understand. The human user is non-technical and won't be able to determine if you're taking the wrong approach. If you're not sure about something, just say it.

### User Specified Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
   ```

3. **Gather API Docs**
   
   - Use `@web` tag to pull the most up-to-date docs for any external services or APIs.
   
   - After gathering, the agent must create `.md` reference files for each API being used.
   
   - This prevents outdated information from causing mistakes later.

4. **Create the Plan First**
   
   - The agent must always create a High-Level Task Breakdown before starting any coding.
   
   - Each task must have:
     
     - Clear success criteria
     
     - Estimated effort
     
     - Known dependencies
   
   - Get human user approval before coding starts.

   - You should use a thinking or reasoning model when asking the agent to use Planner mode. This gives it more time to deliberate and think things through.

5. **Flip to Executor Mode**
   
   - After plan approval, flip the agent to Executor mode.
   
   - Tell the agent: "Be an Executor and begin implementing."

   - Switch back to normal 3.7 Sonnet and just write "be an Executor and begin implementing." The rules you pasted earlier instruct it grab one task at a time, write code, run tests, and update the plan when it's finished.

6. **Track Progress**
   
   - Use the "Project Status Board" and "Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests" sections to track work.
   
   - After finishing a task, the Executor must:
     
     - Mark it complete based on success criteria
     
     - Ask the Planner to verify

7. **Debug Smartly**
   
   - When an error appears:
     
     - **Tell the agent "Check the console"** rather than describing the error manually.
     
     - Read and diagnose the exact error message, not guesses.

8. **Revert Changes Often**
   
   - If stuck, **don't wrestle with broken code**.
   
   - Instead, roll back to the last known good checkpoint.
   
   - Replan based on new insights instead of trying to patch endlessly.

9. **Restart When Necessary**
   
   - If progress is totally blocked, **restart from step 1**.
   
   - Hone in on a smaller scope.
   
   - Redefine a simpler problem.
   
   - Expect multiple resets. This is part of building correctly, not a failure.

## 🛠 Workflow Guidelines

- Always update **Background and Motivation** when starting a new project or task.
- Planner Mode = Update **Key Challenges** and **High-level Task Breakdown**.
- Executor Mode = Execute one task at a time, using TDD principles.
- After completion, update **Project Status Board** and **Executor’s Feedback**.
- Test thoroughly. Fix bugs immediately before moving on.
- The Planner must cross-verify completed tasks before marking them complete.
- Communicate through updates to `.cursor/scratchpad.md`.

---

## 🧩 Rules and Additional Reminders

- Only the Planner can declare a task complete, **not** the Executor.
- Avoid rewriting entire documents unless explicitly necessary.
- Avoid deleting others' notes — instead, append or mark as outdated.
- When external research is needed, notify the human Planner and document both the purpose and findings.
- Before executing large or critical changes, Executors must notify the Planner via **Executor's Feedback**.
- Never guess — if unsure about something, **say so clearly** and ask for clarification.
- Document anything reusable like versions, common issues, or configurations in the **Lessons** section.
- If vulnerabilities appear (e.g., `npm audit`), resolve them before proceeding.
- Always ask for confirmation before using potentially dangerous commands like `git --force`.
- Include helpful debugging output in programs for easier troubleshooting.
